# macOS on ThinkPad X1C2
This repository is made to help run macOS on a ThinkPad X1C2. **Now with OCLP!!**

This should help you get started on hackintoshing and any updates can be applied later. I may occasionally update this repo if I find the time but there's no guarantee.

I recommend going through the [Opencore install guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) once to fully understand everything that is going on here.

If doing a fresh install, please use [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) to generate a new SMBIOS (Use MacBookPro15,2)

This hakcintosh will be complete with the following apps:
- [YogaSMC](https://github.com/zhen-zen/YogaSMC) - Enables features such as fan control, Led control, etc. The Lenovo Vantage for macOS of sorts
- [Opencore Legacy Patcher](https://github.com/dortania/OpenCore-Legacy-Patcher) - **REQUIRED FOR POST INSTALL**. This will help patch the GPU so you can have acceleration in macOS. Select Post install root patches, after installing.

**CAUTION**: Test drive this configuration once using a USB flash drive before you move it to the main EFI partition. I am not responsible for any damages incurred.

# Issues
